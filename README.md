# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high -quality software systems. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools. It is different from the traditional programming because it has evolved in response to the growing complexity of software systems and the need for structural development methodologies and the rise of agile methologies 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
It consists of six phases that includes Requirements, Design, Implementation, Deployment and Maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
There are six phase in software development lige cycle
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile models has iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change while Waterfall has a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards.
The difference is that in waterfall model devides the project into distinct phases but with agile there is flexibility, steps can be done at the same time, it is adaptable to change.
Agile is mostly preferred in dynamic projects that requires frequent feedback and iteration. Waterfall is preferred in projects where all the requirements are well defined and ther is little room for change 

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the systematic approach to the definition, creating  and verification of the requirements for a software system.
It is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
It is important on the software development lifecycle beacuse this phase is used to translate the imprecise, incomplete needs and wishes of the potential users of software into complete precise and formal specification 
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity refers the an approach in software engineering where a complex system is broken down into smaller, loosely coupled modules that has a specific function or handles a particular feature and they interact through well-defined interface. so it empowers developers to manage, update, and scale parts of an application independently, leading to more efficient maintenance and easier stability.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing interacts between different components or subsystems.
System testing is when testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptabce testing  is when the softwareis tested against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing is very crucial in software development to ensure that the product meets specified quality standards and requirements.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control system are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members like Git and Subversion.
Software control systems are important as they they enhance productivity, collaboration, and  code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools and automated testing capabilities 
The examples are Git, Subversion and Mercurial.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software systems. 
They can encounter various challenges throughout the development process including:
Changing  requirements, Tight deadlines, and Technical debt.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
examples are 
preventative maintenance where they prevent future issues, review code, and reduce risks.
Corrective maintenance where fixing bugs, identify, analyse and ensure the software operates correctly.
Maintenance is essential in the sofware lifecycle to ensure sustained success and competitive.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
 Some ethical issues are Algorithmic bias
 Personal data collection 
 Weak security protection 
 They can ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work by actively engaging in ethical discussions, seek guidance, and prioritize responsible practices to build ethically sound software.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
